# About Little Promise Press

Little Promise Press is a small independent publisher focused on
science and STEM books for children.

We create titles that:

- Explain scientific concepts without jargon.
- Include hands‑on activities for home or classroom.
- Encourage curiosity, critical thinking and creativity.

Our goal is for every book to become a little promise:
a shared moment between children and adults to learn together.
